# Linux managment, Assigment 0

1. First step was to create Azure account with my HAMK credentials. I did it on the lesson so there was no problems.
2. Secont step was to request free credits for students.
3. Then we created new virtual machine. Because i folowed instructions on the lecture it was easy. I chose name for it and region, with which was a problem, but after trying few Europe regions, it finally worked on France.Also choosing subscribtion as Azure for students.Choosing x 64 as VM architecture. Then right memory as advised on lecture. I put my short name, Mika, as username. And RSA SSH Format as SSH KeyType.
4. After that going to disk settings, there we check box with Delete with VM and set network sequrity group as Basic, also allowing selected ports.
5. In Managment section we enable auto-shutdown at 7pm by our time zone.
6. After that we didnt change enything else and created VM succesfully.
